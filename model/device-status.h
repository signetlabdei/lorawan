 * network server will send to this device at the first available receive
 * window. Furthermore, this class is used to keep track of all gateways that
 * are able to receive the device's packets. On new packet arrivals at the
 * Network Server, the UpdateGatewayData method is called to update the
 * m_gateways map, that associates a Gateway's PointToPointNetDevice address
 * to the power it received this ED's last packet. This information is then
 * used in the GetSortedGatewayAddresses method to return a list of the
 * preferred gateways through which to reply to this device.
