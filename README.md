# LoRaWAN ns-3 module #

This is an [ns-3](https://www.nsnam.org "ns-3 Website") module that can be used
to perform simulations of a [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan
"LoRa Alliance") network.

[Module Documentation](https://signetlabdei.github.io/lorawan-docs/models/build/html/lorawan.html).

[Doxygen API Documentation](https://www.nsnam.org/docs/doxygen/index.html).

## Getting started ##

### Prerequisites ###

To run simulations using this module, you first need to install ns-3. If you are on Ubuntu/Debian/Mint, you can install the minimal required packages as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install g++ python3 cmake ninja-build git ccache
```

Otherwise please directly refer to the [prerequisites section of the ns-3 installation page](https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation#Prerequisites).

> Note: While the `ccache` package is not strictly required, it is highly recommended. It can significantly enhance future compilation times by saving tens of minutes, albeit with a higher disk space cost of approximately 5GB. This disk space usage can be eventually reduced through a setting.

Then, you need to:

1. Clone the ns-3 codebase,
2. Clone this repository inside the `src` directory therein, and
3. Checkout the latest ns-3 version supported by this module.

You can use the following all-in-one command:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev.git && cd ns-3-dev &&
git clone https://github.com/signetlabdei/lorawan src/lorawan &&
tag=$(< src/lorawan/NS3-VERSION) && tag=${tag#release } && git checkout $tag -b $tag
```

### Compilation ###

Ns-3 adopts a development-oriented philosophy. Before you can run anything, you'll need to compile the ns-3 code. You have two options:

1. **Compile ns-3 as a whole:** Make all simulation modules available by configuring and building as follows (ensure you are in the `ns-3-dev` folder!):

   ```bash
   ./ns3 configure --enable-tests --enable-examples &&
   ./ns3 build
   ```

2. **Focus exclusively on the lorawan module:** To expedite the compilation process, as it can take more than 30/40 minutes on slow hardware, change the configuration as follows:

   ```bash
   ./ns3 clean &&
   ./ns3 configure --enable-tests --enable-examples --enable-modules lorawan &&
   ./ns3 build
   ```

   The first line ensures you start from a clean build state.

Finally, ensure tests run smoothly with:

```bash
./test.py
```

If the script reports that all tests passed or that just `three-gpp-propagation-loss-model` failed[^1], you are good to go.

If other tests fail or crash, consider filing an issue.

[^1]: This is due to [a bug in the current ns-3 version](https://gitlab.com/nsnam/ns-3-dev/-/issues/965) when restricting compilation to the lorawan module and its dependencies. If you need to use the `three-gpp-propagation-loss-model`, you can solve this by compiling ns-3 as a whole or with the `--enable-modules "lorawan;applications"` option to reduce compilation time.

## Usage examples ##

The module includes the following examples:

- `simple-network-example`
- `complete-network-example`
- `network-server-example`
- `adr-example`
- `aloha-throughput`
- `frame-counter-update`
- `lora-energy-model-example`
- `parallel-reception-example`

Examples can be run via the `./ns3 run example-name` command (refer to `./ns3 run --help` for more options).
