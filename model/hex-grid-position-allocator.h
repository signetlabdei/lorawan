 *
 * \brief Position allocator for hexagonal tiling
 *
 * Starting with a first hexagon in the axes' center, following tiles are added in outward
 * rings. The first position returned for a new ring is always the top one, followed by the others
 * in ant-clockwise rotation.
 *
 * Visual example with 10 tiles, indexed 0-9:
 *
 *                     _____
 *                    /     \
 *              _____/   8   \
 *             /     \   ˙   /
 *            /   9   \_____/
 *            \   ˙   /     \
 *       next  \_____/   1   \_____
 *         ˙   /     \   ˙   /     \
 *            /   2   \_____/   7   \
 *            \   ˙   /     \   ˙   /
 *             \_____/   0   \_____/
 *             /     \   ˙   /     \
 *            /   3   \_____/   5   \
 *            \   ˙   /     \   ˙   /
 *             \_____/   4   \_____/
 *                   \   ˙   /
 *                    \_____/
 *
 * The size of tiles can be configured by setting the radius \f$\rho_{i}\f$ of the circle
 * \b inscribed within hexagons (i.e., the internal circle).
 *
 * Let's say that we are placing access points, and we want to cover a square/circular area with
 * hexagonal tiles. This leaves us with two questions: (i) which value should we choose for the
 * internal radius? (ii) how many access point nodes (i.e., tiles) do we need to instantiate?
 *
 * For instamce, to guarantee that no point is further than 1km from the center of any tile (i.e.,
 * to have no uncovered patches), we can choose the radius \f$\rho_{c}\f$ of the
 * \b circumscribed (external) circle of each hexagonal tile to be exactly 1km. Then, question
 * (i) can be solved by setting the internal radius to \f$\rho_{i}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\rho_{c}\f$
 * using the properties of equilateral triangles.
 *
 * To understand how many tiles need to be instantiated (that is, in this example, the number of
 * access point nodes), it is often useful to start from the complete area's diagonal or radius, and
 * to derive the number of complete rings \f$r\f$ required for coverage. Let's say we want to be
 * able to cover a distance of at least \f$d\f$ km from the center. One way to do this can be to
 * take the floor of \f$d\f$ divided by the distance between access points (the tiles' centers),
 * which happens to be \f$2\rho_{i}\f$, and adding one/two ring for good measure. More formally,
 * starting from a single central tile, we would need at least
 * \f$r=\left\lfloor\frac{d}{2\rho_{i}}\right\rfloor+1\f$ \b additional rings around it. Then,
 * the total number of tiles \f$n\f$ in a tiling of \f$r\f$ complete rings around a central tile
 * evaluates to \f$n=3r^{2}-3r+1\f$ providing a possible solution for question (ii).
