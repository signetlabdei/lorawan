 * This class models the behaviour of the chip employed in Lora gateways. These
 * chips are characterized by the presence of 8 receive paths, or parallel
 * receivers, which can be employed to listen to different channels
 * simultaneously. This characteristic of the chip is modeled using the
 * ReceivePath class, which describes a single parallel receiver. GatewayLoraPhy
